    <string name="installer_help"><b>What is SAI?</b>\nSAI (Split APKs Installer) is an app that lets you install multiple APKs as if it was a single package. This is useful for installing apps that are distributed as App Bundles since Android provides no built-in way to install them from sources other than Google Play.\n\n<b>How to use SAI?</b>\nClick \"Install APKs\" button and select base APK and additional configuration-specific APKs or a ZIP archive that contains all required APKs, then click \"Select\" button to start installation process.\n\n<b>.apks</b>\nYou can rename a .zip archive that contains .apk files to .apks (e.g.: somesplitapp.zip -> somesplitapp.apks), so it can be opened with SAI from other apps.\n\n<b>Installing apps from external storage</b>\nYou can long click install button to select files via system file picker that supports external storage.</string>

MIUI is known for breaking standard Android API features and a lot of SAI users have reported installations failing on MIUI for no reason with \"Installation failed\". Usually it can be fixed by disabling MIUI optimizations in developer settings, which I suggest you should do.\n\nOf course you can try using SAI without disabling MIUI optimization, but if it doesn\'t work, try disabling it before complaining to me about failed installations. If your MIUI version doesn\'t have that toggle or it doesn\'t help, there\'s nothing I can do.\n\nThis issue is supposed to be fixed on MIUI 20.2.20 and up (xiaomi.eu and eu-based ROMs).</string>
