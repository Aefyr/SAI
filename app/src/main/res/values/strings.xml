This is useful for installing apps that are distributed as App Bundles since Android provides no built-in way to install them from sources other than Google Play.\n\n<b>How to use SAI?</b>\nClick \"Pick APKs\" button and select base APK as well as additional configuration-specific APKs then click \"Select\" button to start installation process.</string>
